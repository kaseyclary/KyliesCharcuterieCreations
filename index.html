                        <p>My name is Kylie, I am an avid wine & cheese lover spreading my love through creating charcuterie boards for all to enjoy!
                            My love for fine cured meats and cheeses was discovered when I studied abroad in Florence, Italy.
                            Of course, I was drawn to Tuscan wine, (My love for Chianti is unmatched), Aperitivo, Antipasta and PROSCIUTTO.
                            After falling in love with Europe, I spent another semester in Barcelona, Spain. 
                            Spain opened my eyes even more to the wonderful world of meats & cheeses. 
                            I tried the stinkiest of cheeses , the best of jamon, tapas on tapas, and lots and lots of sangria. 
                            After round two in Europe, I came home and could not stop testing out various meat and cheese combos, combining all my favorites from Spain, Italy, Prague, Porto, Everywhere I had traveled. 
                            I found Charcuterie combos inspired my Italian Antipasta, Spanish Tapas, Portuguese wine and cheese pairings and before I knew it, Kylie’s Charcuterie Creations was born!
                            I now love sharing my Charcuterie creations with anyone I possibly can!
                            The ingredients used in my boards are some of the highest quality meats and cheeses you can find in the Des Moines Metro.
                            I personally shop for all items on my boards, often not getting the items until the day of your order to ensure your spread is as fresh as possible!
                             I use various vendors such as local wine & cheese shops, family owned delis and larger corporations to source all products. </p>

                <div class="panel-body">Once you receive your board price, you confirm your order via communication with me.
                 From your given location, I bring all the needed ingredients 
                 & supplies onsite and assemble your board 1-2 hours before your event/when you want your board to be ready by! 
                 Boards are created freshly onsite for all large orders. 
                 Minimum board orders are 6 servings, but you can contact me for smaller requests. 
                 I also do themed boards for holidays, events, birthdays, whatever you are celebrating. 
                 All boards include a variety of high end meats, cheeses, pickled items, spreads, jams, 
                 fruits, complimentary items, sweets, crackers and more! Boards can be used as an appetizer, 
                 or as the main dish, this all depends on how much your group can eat. 
                 I often receive feedback from clients saying they got very full from my portion sizes</div>

                For example, “I don’t want pickles on my board, I want more meat instead” 
                you can request no pickles, but I will choose what substitution to 
                make based on availability and best pairing options. Or requests such as, 
                “for fruits I want blackberries and red grapes” all items are chosen based on season, 
                availability, and what pairs best with other items on your board, please trust the process! 
                PLEASE tell me if you are allergic to any fruits, nuts or oils that may be on your board 
                and I will ensure your board is safe for you to enjoy. 
                Part of the experience is trying items and combinations you wouldn’t typically pick yourself!  </div>
